//Fortis /n
A special pair in an array is a pair of indexes i & j so A[i] = A[j] and 0<i<j<A.length.
for example in the array {1,2,1,2,5,1} there are two special pairs: (0,2) , (0,5) , (2,5) , (1,3) - 4 special pairs.
write an algorithem that counts the number of special pairs in an array.  /n
time complexity - O(nlogn) - can be done better. 
place complexity - O(n)
