Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring (i.e., “waterbottle” is a rotation of “erbottlewat”).



C++ solution:
```c++
bool is_rotation(const string& s1, const string& s2)
{
    string s = s1 + s1;
    return isSubString(s2, s);
}
```
