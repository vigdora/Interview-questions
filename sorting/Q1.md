Sort an Array that contains 3 types of numbers.

complexity have to be O(n)  
algorithem have to be in place - no additional array.
i.e {1,0,0,2,2,1} => {0,0,1,1,2,2}
hints:
-optimal solution can be done with one iteration
-try to answer this question for an array containing only two type of numbers
